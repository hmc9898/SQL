# Zuber Ride Share SQL Analysis

## Project Overview

This project was completed for Zuber, a fictional ride-sharing company interested in expanding its operations in Chicago. The goal was to analyze trip data using SQL to uncover patterns in rider behavior, trip frequency, and demand by time and location. The insights were used to inform strategic decisions regarding partnership opportunities and market expansion.

## Objectives

- Query and explore ride-share trip data across time, geography, and user behavior
- Identify peak demand times and areas of concentrated activity
- Provide actionable recommendations to support business development planning

## Tools & Technologies

- SQL
- Jupyter Notebook (with SQL integration)
- pandas, matplotlib, seaborn (for additional analysis and visualization)

## Data Analysis Approach

- Connected and queried relational database tables using SQL
- Used joins to combine trip, location, and time data
- Applied aggregate functions, filters, and window functions to uncover trends
- Visualized key findings using Python libraries

## Key Insights

- The highest trip volumes were observed in business districts during weekday rush hours
- Weekend activity shifted toward entertainment areas, especially during evenings
- Consistent demand in specific zones suggests strong potential for local partnerships
- Temporal patterns indicated opportunities for fleet allocation optimization

## Business Recommendations

- Prioritize expansion in zones with high weekday and evening activity
- Form partnerships with venues located in consistently high-demand areas
- Develop dynamic pricing models based on peak-hour insights
